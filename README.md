Image Classification Project - Deep Learning UMSL spring 2021.ipynb


This is an image classification project that I completed for a course (compsci 4390) at UMSL in the Spring of 2021.


Abstract:

In my plant classification project, I trained a deep learning model to identify what type of plant appears in an image. I began with an overfitting model, adjusting size, filters, and layers. Next, I split the data to train and evaluate models, examining changes in performance as the number of filters and layers varied. I then created several models using different combinations of data augmentations. I used three types of regularization, individually and in combination, to decrease overfitting. I compared the best of these to several pretrained models and architectures.
